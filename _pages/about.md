The RL-Studio library is an artificial intelligence algorithm programming environment based on learning by reinforcement.

By using standard robotic software such as the ROS communications library and the Gazebo simulator, using the Python programming language, environments can be created where the agent can solve a situation.


# Group discussed papers

We have a paper discussion group where we present and discuss papers related to RL and autonomous driving. Here, you can find the references
to the already presented papers.
