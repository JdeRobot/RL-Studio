## Working with Posts

Posts are stored in the `_posts` directory and named according to the `YEAR-MONTH-DAY-title.MARKUP` format as per the usual.

Where `YEAR` is a four-digit number, `MONTH` and `DAY` are both two-digit numbers, and `MARKUP` is the file extension representing the format used in the file. For example, the following are examples of valid post filenames:


```bash
2019-08-20-writing-jekyll-posts.md
```

It is recommended to store the images in the `/assets/images/` directory. This way you have a well-defined structure.
