## How do you use them?

The equations admitted are those usually used in Latex and Markdown. Thanks to the mathjax library they are rendered.

$$
\frac{-b\pm\sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}
$$

Thanks to this library and the integration with Minimal Mistakes, the result of your documentation will look spectacular.
